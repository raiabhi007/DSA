# Aggressive Cows
## Medium
<div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size:18px">You are given an <strong>array</strong> consisting of <strong>N integers</strong> which denote the position of a stall. You are also given an <strong>integer</strong> <strong>k</strong> which denotes the number of aggressive cows. You are given the task of <strong>assigning stalls to K cows</strong> such that the <strong>minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">The first line of input contains two integers N and K.<br>
The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the position of the stalls.</span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong>
5 3
A = [1 2 4 8 9]
<strong>Output:</strong>
3
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The first cow can be placed at A[0], the second cow can be placed at A[2] and the third cow can be placed at A[3]. The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 3, which also is the largest among all possible ways.</span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
Complete the function int solve(), which takes integer N, K, and a vector with N integers as input and returns the largest possible minimum distance between cows.</span></p>
